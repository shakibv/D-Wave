Solver Parameters:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The solver parameters are passed as a dictionary to %%FUNCTIONNAME%%. Each of
the parameters can be passed as a key with values as described below.

Key:                  Value:

-s                    a positive integer representing the number of sweeps %%DefineSweep%

-r                    a positive integer representing the number of repetitions

-b0                   [beta0] is initial inverse temperature. Default value: 0.1

-b1                   [beta1] is final inverse temperature. Default value: 3.0

-r0                   [rep0] is starting repetition. Default value: 0

-v                    if -v is set, timing and some other info is printed.
                      Default value: not set

-g                    if -g is set, only the lowest energy solution is printed.
                      Default value: not set

-sched                specifies a schedule. It can either be lin, exp or be a
                      text file on the system which contains an inverse
                      temperature on every line. Default value: lin

-t                    is the number of threads to run in parallel. Default
                      value: OMP NUM THREADS
