Simulated Annealing Solver Tutorial

  *** Note that all steps/procedures described are intended for use on a 
      machine running Windows 10. ***

================================================================================
Quickstart/Tutorial:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CONFIGURING DEPENDENCIES:
-------------------------
This code requires a C++11 compatible compilier to be callable from any 
subdirectory within the command prompt. If you already have this setup, skip to
the last section.

  1. First, you need a C++11 compatible compiler. Download and install the MinGW 
     Installer from the downloads page on http://www.mingw.org/.
  2. Open MinGW installer. On the left hand pane, select "Basic Setup", then, 
     in the centre pane, select the tick box for "mingw32-gcc-g++-bin" and 
     choose "Mark for Installation". From the "Installation" drop-down menu, 
     select "Apply Changes". This will install the compiler.
  3. Now the compiler needs to be added to your system path so that it is 
     callable within the command prompt from any directory. On Windows 10, 
     open your advanced system settings by clicking the Windows flag on your 
     task bar and typing "Advanced System Settings" and selecting "View
     advanced system settings".
  4. Click "Environment Variables". Under the subheading "System Variables",
     choose "Path" and click "Edit".
  5. Click "New" and, assuming that you let MinGW install in its default 
     location, paste C:\MinGW\bin into the new entry. If you installed MinGW
     in a different location, navigate to that location, then to the "bin"
     subdirectory and past that address into the new entry.
  6. Click "Ok" three times to close all advanced system variables windows.
     

TESTING THE SIMULATED ANNEALING CODE:
-------------------------------------

  1. Download the folder entitled simulated_annealing. The bin folder within
     contains the simulated annealing source codes. All of these files
     must stay in the same directory, but the directory can be moved/renamed
     if desired.
  2. Open the Python file "send_to_SA.py" in a Python IDE.
  3. Add the line:

	print(SA(r"C:\users\John\Documents", "instance.txt"))

     to the end of the file, changing the first parameter to the absolute
     path of the bin folder that you downloaded in step 1.
  4. Run the file.
  
COMMON ERRORS:
--------------
If you get an error when you run the file, try adding an "r" before the 
directory input you changed in step 3 above. For example:

    r"C:\Users\user\Downloads\simulated_annealing\bin"

Note that ALL directory path parameters (directory, save, solverDir)
must be raw strings, meaning that they must be written in the form:

	r"..."
 
VERIFYING SUCCESS:
------------------
The code has run successfully if the console displays the following:

(-360, 200)
